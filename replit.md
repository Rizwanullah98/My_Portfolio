3. Tailwind CSS automatically applies dark mode styles
4. Theme preference saved to localStorage
5. On page load, saved theme preference and system preference are detected and applied

### Navigation Flow
1. User clicks navigation link or scrolls
2. JavaScript calculates current section position
3. Active navigation state updates dynamically
4. Smooth scrolling animation triggered for link clicks

### Contact Form Flow
1. User fills out contact form
